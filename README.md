# 🎓 EduGuide Sri Lanka

**EduGuide Sri Lanka** is a smart, student-centered guidance platform that helps Sri Lankan students choose the most appropriate **A/L subject streams** and **university pathways** based on their personal interests, skills, and performance. The project integrates **Machine Learning** for stream recommendations and an **NLP-based university chatbot** for higher education and career guidance.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📚 **A/L Stream Recommendation**  
  Predicts the most suitable A/L subject stream (Science, Commerce, Arts, etc.) based on student responses to a survey using ML models.

- 💬 **University & Career Guidance Chatbot**  
  Built using **Flask**, **Sentence-BERT**, and **semantic search**, this NLP-powered assistant helps students explore:
  - Private and state universities
  - Suitable degrees based on skills and interests
  - Career options based on stream or Z-score

- 📊 **Survey Data Collection**  
  Collects student inputs such as favorite subjects, career interests, and skills to create a rich dataset for training and predictions.

- 🌐 **Web-Based Interface**  
  - 🖥️ Frontend: React-based multi-step chatbot UI

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Students complete a short survey** about their interests and skills.
2. The ML backend **predicts the most suitable A/L stream** using a stacking ensemble model.
3. The chatbot UI collects further info (e.g., Z-score, degree of interest).
4. Flask chatbot uses **Sentence-BERT** to provide:
   - 🎯 Career guidance
   - 🏫 University recommendations (private and state)
   - 📋 Degree suggestions based on inputs
